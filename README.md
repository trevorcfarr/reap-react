# Reap Api Testing

This is a simple React application that allows you to test the Reap API.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `yarn`
3. Run `yarn dev`

## Notes

- The data is mocked and will be replaced with the actual API call later.
- The data is displayed in a table.
- The table headers are sortable by clicking on the header of each column.
